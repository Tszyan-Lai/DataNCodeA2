## General Information
The project intends to break down barriers to music creation. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate that music-making can be approachable and playful, especially for beginners and non-musicians, by using coding as an alternative and accessible creative tool. I undertook this project to step into a creative space beyond just being a listener. I wanted to contribute artistically by using code as a means of creative expression and to engage with the music of SEVENTEEN in a new, interactive way as a fan.
